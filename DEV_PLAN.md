# DEV_PLAN.md â€” QTI: Living Memory and Development Plan

## Principles
- Preserve the topological/self-reflective nature.
- Cover every stage with tests.
- Minimalism and honesty above all.

## Current TODO
- [ ] Translate all Russian docstrings and comments in code to English.
- [ ] Integrate LLM loading/extraction into QTI workflow.
- [ ] Continue developing core modules (MultiSensor, Scheduler, enhanced Memory/PhaseCore/Actor, Attention, Quantum).

## Insight
- The wow-effect is achieved by depth and clarity, not by graphics. Minimalism is the new wow.

## Open Tasks (for community)
- [ ] Integrate a new sensor type (e.g., image or biosignal sensor)
- [ ] Expand FAQ with more philosophical and technical questions

## Manifesto
> We do not build intelligence. We invite it to emerge.
