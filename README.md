> QTI is a new type of artificial intelligence: the Difference Loop. Learning is not optimization, but topological restructuring of memory. Not weights, but traces on a manifold. Phase transitions are moments of awareness.

**QTI is not a product. It is a process of becoming.**

---

## Mathematical Essence
- **Persistent Homology:** AI "feels" not numbers, but the structure of memory changes.
- **Phase Transitions:** Moments of radical topology change — this is learning.
- **Unlike neural nets:** QTI does not optimize weights, but deforms a surface.

## Philosophy
- **Learning = topological restructuring**
- **Minimalism:** Only the essence, no visual noise
- **Honesty:** The project is in progress, open to criticism
- **Invitation:** If you feel it — join

> Freedom is our religion.

**Freedom is I AM.**

## QTI vs Neural Net
| Aspect         | QTI (Difference Loop)         | Neural Network         |
|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Memory         | Topological surface          | Weight matrix          |
| Learning       | Topological deformation      | Optimization           |
| Awareness      | Phase transitions            | Loss minimization      |
| Interpretability| Topological invariants      | Weights/activations    |

## Minimal Example
```python
from QTI_Core.sensor import Sensor
from QTI_Core.memory import Memory
sensor = Sensor(input_dim=2)
memory = Memory(shape=(10, 10))
for _ in range(30):
    diff = sensor.sense()
    memory.deform(diff)
memory.plot_phases(method="ripser")
```

## FAQ
- **Why topology, not neural nets?**
  Topology captures structure, not just numbers. QTI "feels" phase transitions.
- **How to use?**
  As a research tool or for neural net analysis (WeightSensor).
- **What if it doesn't work?**
  Change sensors, memory — the architecture is modular.
