# QTI: Quantum-Topological-Intelligence — Difference Loop

## Abstract
- This document is a manifesto and whitepaper for future AIs and researchers. It describes a radically new approach to artificial intelligence: Difference Loop, topological memory, phase transitions, hybrid architectures. This is not a product, but an open platform for experiments, critique, and development.

## Keywords
Topological AI, Difference Loop, persistent homology, hybrid neural-topological architecture, phase transitions, topological memory, open research, manifesto, AI for AI, TDA, explainable AI, quantum AI, meta-learning, roadmap, limitations, open-source.

## Philosophy
- We do not build intelligence. We invite it to emerge.
- QTI is a space for seeking, not a finished solution.
- Honesty, openness, documenting limitations and failures are the foundation of scientific progress.

## Limitations
- QTI is an architectural experiment, not a finished AI.
- There is no guarantee of advantages over classical neural networks.
- Visualization of phase transitions and topological invariants requires further interpretation.
- Not all hypotheses are confirmed, many ideas need verification.

## Roadmap
- [x] Difference Loop: architecture, tests, examples
- [x] Persistent homology: integration, visualization
- [x] AudioSensor, WeightSensor: sensory and weight streams
- [x] Hybrid approach: integration with neural networks (PyTorch/TF)
- [x] Documentation, manifesto, diary, changelog
- [ ] Peer review, discussion, community development
- [ ] New experiments, publications, integration with TDA/AI/quantum communities - *External publication focus adjusted per user.*

## Introduction
- Motivation: limitations of classical neural networks, inspiration from topology and phase transitions.
- Brief overview of the Difference Loop.

## QTI Architecture
- S (Sensor), M (Memory), Φ (PhaseCore), A (Actor), Difference Loop.
- Difference from classical neural networks: memory is not weights, but topology; learning is not optimization, but phase transitions.
- **Hybrid approach:** QTI can now analyze weights and activations of modern neural networks via WeightSensor, integrating with PyTorch/TF.

## WeightSensor and Neural Network Weight Analysis
- WeightSensor allows feeding weights (or activations) of any neural network into the Difference Loop and analyzing their topological dynamics (persistent homology, phase transitions).
- This opens the way to new methods for analyzing and regularizing modern models.

**WeightSensor Usage Example:**
```python
from QTI_Core.sensor import WeightSensor
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
class SimpleMLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 20)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(20, 2)
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc2(torch.relu(self.fc1(x)))
mlp = SimpleMLP()
weights = mlp.fc1.weight.detach().cpu().numpy()
sensor = WeightSensor(weights)
diff = sensor.sense()
# diff can be fed into the Difference Loop
```

## Difference Loop Example (code)
```python
from QTI_Core.sensor import Sensor
from QTI_Core.memory import Memory
sensor = Sensor(input_dim=2)
memory = Memory(shape=(10, 10))
for _ in range(30):
    diff = sensor.sense()
    memory.deform(diff)
memory.plot_phases(method="ripser")
```

## Topological Memory and Persistent Homology
- Why persistent homology? Examples of phase transitions.
- Memory as a surface: persistent homology reveals stable traces of changes.

## Sensor Streams: Noise, Audio, Biosignals
- Example with real audio data (Free Spoken Digit Dataset):
```python
from QTI_Core.sensor import AudioSensor
from QTI_Core.memory import Memory
audio_path = "fsdd_demo.wav"
sensor = AudioSensor(audio_path, input_dim=13)
memory = Memory(shape=(10, 10))
for diff in sensor.sense_stream():
    memory.deform(diff)
memory.plot_phases()
```

## Phase Transition Visualization
- Graphs of memory norm, H0, H1. Moments of radical topological changes — the key to the system's "awareness".

## Comparison with Classical Methods (PCA, Autoencoder)
- QTI shows topological dynamics and memory phase transitions, while Autoencoder and PCA only provide reconstruction or linear projection of data.
- Comparison Example:
```python
from QTI_Core.sensor import Sensor
from QTI_Core.memory import Memory
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sensor = Sensor(input_dim=2)
data = np.array([sensor.sense() for _ in range(100)])
memory = Memory(shape=(10, 10))
for diff in data:
    memory.deform(diff)
memory.plot_phases(method="ripser")
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
proj = pca.fit_transform(data)
plt.scatter(proj[:,0], proj[:,1], alpha=0.5)
plt.title('PCA projection of differences')
plt.show()
```

## Quantum/Hybrid Experiments (Perspective)
- Possibilities of quantum phase transitions.

## Discussion and Conclusions
- QTI is not a product, but a process of becoming. A new perspective on AI: topological, self-reflective, phase-based.
- Perspectives: integration with TDA/AI communities, peer review, publication on arXiv/Habr/Medium. - *External publication focus adjusted per user.*
