## How to Contribute

1. **Submitting a Pull Request (PR):**
   - Before submitting a PR, make sure your code passes all tests (`pytest tests/`).
   - Describe the purpose of your changes, add links to relevant issues/roadmap.
   - Follow the PEP8 code style, use docstrings for all public methods and classes.

2. **Testing:**
   - Each new module should be accompanied by tests (unit/integration).
   - Place tests in the `tests/` folder, use `unittest` or `pytest`.

3. **Discussing Ideas:**
   - Propose new ideas and improvements via GitHub Issues.
   - For large changes, create an issue for discussion first.

4. **How to Propose a New Module (example: Attention, QuantumSensor, Scheduler):**
   - Create an issue with a description of the task, expected result, links to literature/examples.
   - Attach a minimal API example (init, process, docstring).
   - Discuss architectural integration with the Difference Loop.

5. **Code Style:**
   - PEP8, docstrings in Russian or English (the main thing is clarity).
   - Comments for non-obvious code sections are mandatory.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Update README.md and/or QTI_Technical_Details.md when adding new features.
   - Add usage examples and visualizations if possible.

7. **Roadmap and DEV_PLAN:**
