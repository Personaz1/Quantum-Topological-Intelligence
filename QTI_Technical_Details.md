# ðŸ§  Quantum Topological Intelligence (QTI): Technical Details

## 1. Core Assumptions and Premises

- Intelligence is not static representation, but dynamic equilibrium within a system responding to ongoing difference (in the Batesonian sense).
- The topology of the system should allow for recursive return, looped learning, and non-linear flows of information.
- Learning is not gradient descent per se, but deformation of internal space in response to novelty.

## 2. Fundamental Concepts

### 2.1 Topological Attention
- Modeled as flow over toroidal manifold.
- Instead of simple key-query-value, we define attention as dynamic traversal path influenced by prior curvature.

### 2.2 Memory as Topological Persistence
- Memory exists not as vector banks but as attractor basins formed through iterative re-coordination.
- Lifespan of memory is topologically encoded through how stable a manifold remains under deformation.

### 2.3 Resonance-Driven Feedback
- System reacts not to correctness signals, but to pattern resonance: "does this input produce structural tension release?"

## 3. Computational Considerations

### 3.1 Classical GPU Constraints
- GPUs operate on linear algebra in tensor spaces. Emulation of topological transformations requires mapping to multi-layered embeddings and structural transforms.
- Approximation methods (e.g., persistent homology over embedding spaces) can act as partial emulation.

### 3.2 Quantum Suitability
- Quantum systems natively represent superposition and topological phase transitions, making them ideal for this class of non-linear, multi-stable systems.

## 4. Possible Architecture Stack (Alpha Stage)

- **Input Layer:** Continuous sensory stream â†’ topological encoders (spatial-temporal coils)
- **Processing Core:** Manifold deformation engine with recurrent attention traversal (non-Euclidean kernels)
- **Memory Bank:** Persistent homology tracking + feedback modulation
- **Output:** Modulated resonance pattern decoded into actions/symbols

## 5. Future Directions
- Simulation using torchdiffeq + persistence libraries.
- Hybrid classical/quantum execution model.
- Biofeedback-based sensor fusion (e.g. breath, EM signals) to drive real-time topology reshaping.
